## Security Best Practices for Contributors

All contributors are expected to:

- Follow secure coding practices (e.g., input validation, error handling).
- Avoid introducing hardcoded secrets or credentials.
- Ensure dependencies are up-to-date and do not introduce known vulnerabilities.
- Use signed commits (`git commit -s`) and follow the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.
- Run and pass all static analysis, lint, and vulnerability scanning tools included in the CI pipeline.

## Dependencies and Supply Chain

`quartzctl` uses the following tools to help detect known CVEs and maintain secure dependencies:

- [govulncheck](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck)
- [gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec)
- GitHub Dependabot (enabled for this repository)

We are working toward full [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) compliance.
