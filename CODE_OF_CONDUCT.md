## 🧑‍⚖️ Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions (commits, code, issues, comments, PRs, etc.) that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate.

## 🛠 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces (like GitHub issues, PRs, and discussions) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

---

## 📢 Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at:

📫 **sblair@metrostar.com**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
